  <h1>Forward Echo</h1>
  <h2>November 9 – December 19, 2020</h2>
<p>What can connection look like in a world where we increasingly translate ourselves into the universe through digital languages?</p>
<p>In digital technology, when information is mistranslated or lost it can appear as a glitch. As our bodies move across the world, cultural or oral history becomes lost, missing, or even stolen. Gender bends, amidst the chasm of displaced earth turning industrial manufacturing into the age of information. In the wake of this we meditate on a new reality annexed from context - as mystical as a glitch in real life. The artists in Forward Echo turn to visual storytelling to construct new realities that speak to our hyperfaceted existences, creating a new language that bridges incongruent worlds.</p>
<p>Through painting & performance, digital image & recycled sculpture, the artists explore different visual forms to communicate that which is unspoken, untranslatable, or perhaps not yet been said through words, sight or sound. Conveyed through multimedia explorations, the artists begin a conversation about the evershifting modes of connection, identity, and existence — here, digitally, and beyond the ether.</p>
