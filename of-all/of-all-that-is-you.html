  <h1>Of All That Is You ~ Meg Fransee & Mika Yokota</h1>
  <h2>October 25 – December 15, 2018</h2>
<p>Through the lens of two distinct artists, the gallery is transformed through imagined spaces where personal mythology and collective narratives unfold. Speaking with paint, pens, and sculptural forms, both artists depict figures engaging in playful explorations of their selves, and of each other, as they tumble around an invisible, inner world. Light, shadow, the figure, and nature, are threaded to discover our paths to our highest beings — what results is an immersive experience into the creative mindsets of these two artists.

	<h1>Mika Yokota</h1>
  <h2><a href="https://www.mikayokota.com/" target="blank">mikayokota.com</a></h2>
<p>Mika Yokota's practice is a meditation on the physical self as a vessel to receive cosmic lessons from the spirit realm. The women characters engage in playful explorations of their selves, and of each other, as they tumble around the invisible, inner world. They investigate the deep, complex cavities of our psyche and reveal the light and shadow in each human experience.
